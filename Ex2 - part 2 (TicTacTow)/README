The Whatever player randomizes a set of numbers and places his mark according to the them. The chances to win at random
are slim at best when the board size is 6 and are getting better as the board size are getting smaller. On the other
hand, if the board is getting bigger the chances are getting smaller and smaller. The same thing happens with the win
streak length. To sum it up, the Whatever player will loose a big percentage of his games, with the only exception
being the games he will play against another Whatever player. In that case the win\lose distribution will be
around 50:50 with some games that will finish in a draw.

The Clever player tries to finish a streak, one row at a time. If he encountered the second player mark he will simply
skip over it and continue to fill up the row. this strategy is very effective against the Whatever player. The downside
is that against a player that knows about the his strategy, the Clever player will always loose. It is a strategy that
is easy to block.
