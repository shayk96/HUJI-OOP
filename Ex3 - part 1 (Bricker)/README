=============================
I chose to implement the design as it is now because of several reasons:
first of all, the game engine given to us made it easy to design in this way.
secondly, the structure has a very clear logic: a package for the game objects and a package for the brick strategies.
there is no overlapping responsibilities between the packages and the purpose of each package is clear.
the classes are well focused. there is a single class for every game object and the functions that each class implements
are limited to the class only, no action is preformed on another class.

=============================
The main class is the BrickerGameClass. the class manages the game and centralizes all the options for the game.
in this way, any change a user wants to do is easy to implement.
the distinct purpose of the two packages also makes sense.
