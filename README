for each pixel the program goes through the chars and finds the char with the closest brightness and replaces the pixel
with the matching char. the same goes for a sub image.
for each pixel the program transforms it from colored to grey by using the formula given to us by the course staff.
than calculating the the brightness of an image the programs sums up all the pixels gery scale and divides it by the
number of pixels.
